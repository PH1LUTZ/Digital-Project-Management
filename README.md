## Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Formula:**  
Present value of expected benefit = Future¬†benefit/(1+Discount¬†rate)ùëõ
Cost-benefit ratio = Present¬†value¬†of¬†(expected¬†benefit‚Äã/project¬†cost)

**Calculation:**  
- Discount rate: 20%
- Future benefit: $36,000
- Present value of expected benefit: $30,000
- Present¬†value¬†of¬†project cost: $15,000
- Cost-benefit ratio: 2

**Investment Outcome:** The investment is positive as the cost-benefit ratio is greater than 1, indicating profitability.
